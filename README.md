# 🎮 Born Again: A Life Simulation Game

**Born Again** is an ambitious, mobile-first life simulation game that mimics real-world systems like banking, crypto, real estate, personal well-being, and social mobility — all from the palm of your hand.

> 💡 Instead of building separate beginner projects, I decided to **link everything into one immersive simulator** — a digital life you can control, customize, and (eventually) conquer.

## 🌱 Why I’m Building This

I'm a beginner — and instead of making simple, disconnected tutorials like *"build a to-do app"*, I’m building a **living, breathing ecosystem** that combines everything those smaller projects teach... but in a more challenging, fun, and impactful way.

This game helps me learn *by doing* — from UI/UX and DOM manipulation to real-time systems and game design.

## ⚠️ Please Note

- 🐣 The game is **only about 2% complete**
- 🐛 It has **many bugs, quirks, and missing pieces**
- 🎨 It’s **mobile-only for now**
- 🔧 It’s built in vanilla JS but I plan to **rebuild parts of it in React** once I learn it properly
